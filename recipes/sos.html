    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dish was a staple in my family when I was a kid up until my father who was a veteran passed away. I enjoyed it every time he made it, even if it wasn't the healthiest thing to eat.</p>

    <p>Obviously gravy isn't that healthy, and beef has had a bad link to heart disease.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>2 cubes chicken bouillon, crumbled</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups low-fat milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; stir in the ground beef, chicken bouillion, garlic powder, black pepper, and onion powder. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, about 7 minutes</li>
        <li>Stir in the flour and cook for 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in the milk and bring to a simmer, stirring constantly. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 5 minutes to thicken.</li>
    </ol>
