    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I'm not sure what's more Tex-Mex than flour tortilla enchiladas. As a mostly Irish heritage American born, I love flour tortillas and have never been that crazy about corn tortillas.</p>
    <p>Ryan Volgelsong was a major league baseball pitcher and before every start he'd have chicken enchiladas, so if you thought this dish was heavy, it wasn't heavy enough hamper his performances.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped green onions</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
        <li>1 (4 ounce) can diced green chiles</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups cubed cooked chicken breast meat</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>6 (12 inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a large baking dish.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Saute green onions in hot butter until tender, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add garlic powder, then stir in condensed soup, green chiles, and sour cream. Mix a sauce until well combined. Reserve 3/4 of the sauce in a bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add chicken and 1/2 cup cheese to remaining sauce in the pan; stir until cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Fill each flour tortilla with chicken mixture and roll up. Place seam-side down in the prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Stir milk into reserved sauce in the bowl and spoon over rolled tortillas. Top with remaining 1/2 cup cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
