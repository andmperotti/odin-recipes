    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Nothing to me is better than a perfectly crafted barbecue rib with either bbq sauce or rub. This recipe is the former, so make sure you have plenty of napkins.</p>
    <p>As a kid I loved eating these and didn't care how messy I got, but now that I'm nearing 40 I have to think of heartburn and how to clean myself up after. I still think it's worth it to be honest.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds pork spareribs</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours. Unwrap and drain drippings. (I usually freeze drippings to use later in soups.) Place ribs in a large roasting pan.</li>
